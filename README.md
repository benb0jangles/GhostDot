> **Advanced targeting computer and targeting system for precision airsoft sports**

A next-generation smart optic that combines real-time environmental sensing, inertial tracking, and target computation to deliver professional-grade target correction in a compact, affordable package.

---

## 🌟 Overview

The **Smart Target System** is a revolutionary precision aiming solution designed for airsoft, and training applications. By integrating multiple sensors and real-time computational targeting, GhostDot provides airsoft with instant hold-over/hold-under corrections, wind compensation, and target tracking capabilities previously only available in 6th-Gen systems.

### Key Features

- **🎯 IMU-Based Target Tracking** - Advanced IMU sensor provides stable target lock with sub-degree accuracy
- **🌪️ Real-Time Wind Compensation** - Integrated anemometer calculates wind drift and displays MOA corrections
- **📏 Laser Rangefinding Integration** - Automatic ballistic drop calculation based on target distance
- **⚙️ Configurable Ballistics** - Support for multiple calibers (.177, .22, .25) with grain weight adjustment
- **🖥️ Multi-Mode HUD** - Four specialized display modes for different operational scenarios
- **🔋 Low Power Design** - Hours of continuous operation on a single charge
- **📡 Tactical Navigation** - Geo-enabled waypoint navigation and team coordination display
- **🛰️ Motion Tracking** - Advanced threat detection and situational awareness system

## 💡 Usage

### Controls

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Short Press** | Select/Lock target (Targeting mode) |
| **Short Press** | Cancel target lock (when locked) |
| **Long Press (1s)** | Cycle through display modes |

### Display Modes

1. **Targeting Mode** - Primary aiming reticle with ballistic corrections
2. **Navigation Mode** - waypoint guidance and team communications
3. **Motion Tracker** - 360° radar-style threat detection
4. **Team Status** - Squad coordination and mission overview

### Target Lock Procedure

1. Aim at target through crosshair
2. Press button to activate tracking
3. Target reticle appears and follows aim point via IMU
4. When centered on crosshair, displays "LOCKED"
5. Fire when correction indicators are aligned
